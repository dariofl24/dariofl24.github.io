    Here is where all site-specific global js resources are to be included in the EMEA localized cartridges.
    This template is just a stub, which should be overriden by a template with the same name in each cartridge when needed.
    This would allow to fine-tune what resources get loaded for each specific site. 
    Such tempalate would typically include app.emea.js plus some site-specific scripts.
